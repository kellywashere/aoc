There is only ne tgl instruction in input program, at line 17

I added dbg output to show which instructions get altered. This is required when I
start modding the original program (after adding mul instruction): I need to make
sure the modded instructions are not part of the toggling, or the functionality
would be impacted.
If I do not touch lines below tgl instruction (starting at line 18) functionality should
not be impacted.

I add following instructions:
add x r
	adds x to register r (order consistent with cpy instr)
mul x r
	multiplies content of register r by x (order consistent with cpy instr)
nop
	does nothing (to fill up space)

Then I mod the original program to use the new instructions.

input --> a
# next section does: b = a-1; d = a
	cpy a b
	dec b
	cpy a d

# next section does: a = b * d; c = 0; d = 0;
cpy 0 a
	L1:
	cpy b c

	# next 3 instr: a += c; c = 0
		L2:
		inc a
		dec c
		jnz c L2

	dec d
	jnz d L1


# next 3 instr: --b; c = b; d = b;
	dec b
	cpy b c
	cpy c d

# next 3 instr: c += d; d = 0;
	L3:
	dec d
	inc c
	jnz d L3
